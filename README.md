# Generative AI LangChain Hackathon

LangChain is a Python framework for developing applications using language models. It abstracts the connection between applications and LLMs, allowing a loose coupling between code and specific foundation models like Google PaLM.

This repository details 3 ways to get started with LangChain, and walks-through setting up a Q&A over Documentation example.
