# LangChain Hackathon

LangChain is a Python framework for developing applications using language models. It abstracts the connection between applications and LLMs, allowing a loose coupling between code and specific providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.

This repository details 3 ways to get started with LangChain, and walks-through setting up a Q&A over Documentation example.
1. Python script: view the README in `/langchain_demo` to run the complete demo as a local script using `poetry`.
2. Local JuPyter notebook: view the `langchain_demo.ipynb` notebook to run the tutorial as a local notebook using `poetry`.
3. CoLab JuPyter notebook: visit [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zacharysmithdatatonic/langchain-demo/blob/main/langchain_demo.ipynb) to run the tutorial as an online notebook.
