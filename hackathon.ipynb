    "\n",
    "This notebook walks you through the challenge of implementing a **Knowledge Worker** for your organisation using **Generative AI**!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why a knowledge worker?** Decentralized data across internal and external databases results in time wasted as workforce tries to find required information and transform into insights. A knowledge worker can consolidate this information, then answer queries in natural language providing summarisation and sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Q&A Chain intro](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/bca8120f1408be1895309517a7a4d693035b940b/assets/qa_intro.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ **Your task:** Implement a knowledge worker to enable users in your company to perform Q&A, in natural language, upon a knowledge base.\n",
    "In this way, you'll centralise company data for easy access in a user-friendly manner, boosting productivity.\n",
    "As such, you'll create a knowledge worker fine-tuned to your data domain.\n",
    "This app will only have access to specific knowledge such as public data about your company available on your company's website and unstructured documents (websites, PDF, Word, text ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "While solving the tasks as instructed in this notebook, you'll familiarise yourself with common concepts and tools for Generative AI including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Open-Source tool LangChain\n",
    "- Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "- Vertex AI Search\n",
    "- Prompts and Prompt Engineering\n",
    "- Text Embeddings and Vector Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this notebook details how to get started with LangChain, and walks through setting up a knowledge worker on Google Cloud and Vertex AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing a knowledge worker\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a knowledge worker, you'll recall that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be tuned for a variety of tasks such as text summarization, answering questions, and generating new content (and many more!).\n",
    "When it comes to tuning approaches, you'll have the choice between:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A) Zero-shot learning:** Use LLMs directly without providing additional data or fine-tuning the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B) Few-shot learning:** Provide a select number of input examples when using LLM to improve the quality of outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C) Model Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune certain (or additional) layers in the LLM by training the model on provided training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of training LLMs using your own data (ie. fine-tuning), it is far easier and more effective to adapt the LLM to your use-case by prompt engineering only (ie. tuning).\n",
    "Thus, methods A) and B) are more applicable for creating your first knowledge worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge worker can be approached in two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Embedding knowledge from diverse sources.\n",
    "    * Load our dataset.\n",
    "    * Shard our documents (e.g.: by paragraph, per 1000 tokens, etc.)\n",
    "    * Embed the documents in Vertex AI Search or a vector store.\n",
    "2. Querying a LLM which is aware of your relevant knowledge to answer questions.\n",
    "    * Locating relevant documents from Vertex AI Search or a vector store.\n",
    "    * Asking the LLM our query, providing relevant knowledge as context to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Q&A Chain Flow](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/bca8120f1408be1895309517a7a4d693035b940b/assets/qa_flow.jpeg?raw=true)\n",
    "First, documents (websites, Word documents, databases, Powerpoints, PDFs, etc.) are loaded and split into chunks. Fragmenting is important for three reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are technical restrictions on how much data (tokens) can be fed into an LLM at once, meaning the context + system prompt + chat history + user prompt must fit within the token limit.\n",
    "2. Most LLM APIs operate on a per-token pricing model, meaning it is cost-effective to limit the size / amount of data provided to the LLM per query.\n",
    "3. Contextual information should be relevant to the user query, meaning it is optimal to provide only relevant snippets from documents, making the answer more relevant whilst saving costs as per (1) and (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, these document shards are embedded within a vector store. Embedding a document means to align it within a multi-dimension space, which can then be searched according to user queries to find relevant documents. Document relevancy scoring can be as simple as a K-neighbours search, since embedded documents with similarity (as percieved by the LLM embedding model) will be proximate within the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A typical ingestion chain](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/7f37d477b18ace5912d34b0574512559d7a457ed/assets/typical-ingestion-chain.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vector store is created, a user can query the knowledge base using natural language questions. Relevant documents related to the query are found in the vector store by embedding the user query and finding local documents. These snippets of text are provided to the LLM (alongside the user query, chat history, prompt engineering, etc.) which parses the information to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A typical query chain](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/7f37d477b18ace5912d34b0574512559d7a457ed/assets/typical-query-chain.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running this workshop\n",
    "* Execute each code snippet sequentially. This lab is designed so certain steps (like defining functions or importing modules) are performed once, so each new code cell builds upon previous cells.\n",
    "* If the notebook crashes or you want to restart the notebook later, make sure you execute all cells prior to where you left off.\n",
    "* Executing cells out of order can lead to errors, so your first step when debugging should be to ensure all previous code cells have been run.\n",
    "* This workshop can be completed independently, but Datatonic workshop leaders are available to discuss tasks, debug issues, or have a chat about generative AI!\n",
    "\n",

This method is similar to the [`RecursiveUrlLoader`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/integrations/recursive_url_loader). This document loader searches for subpages of a website and loads each pages content as a document. Additionally, if we only wanted to download a list of URLs without searching for subpages, we could use a [`UnstructuredURLLoader`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/integrations/url).\n",

    "# Task 4: Extending the chain\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you've created two types of chains:\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLMChain\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LLMChain` is a simple chain that adds some functionality around language models.\n",
    "It is used widely throughout LangChain, including in other chains and agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLMChain consists of a **PromptTemplate** and a **language model** (either an LLM or chat model).\n",
    "It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided (and also memory key values, if available), passes the formatted string to LLM and returns the LLM output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=PROMPT)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ConversationalRetrievalChain\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ConversationalRetrievalQA` chain builds on RetrievalQAChain to provide a chat history component.\n",
    "\n",
    "It first combines the chat history (either explicitly passed in or retrieved from the provided memory) and the question into a standalone question, then looks up relevant documents from the retriever, and finally passes those documents and the question to a question answering chain to return a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create one, you will need a retriever.\n",
    "In the below example, we will create one from a vector store, which can be created from embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(k=k)\n",
    "model = VertexAI(temperature=temperature)\n",
    "chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(\n",
    "    llm=model,\n",
    "    retriever=retriever,\n",
    "    return_source_documents=True,\n",
    "    condense_question_prompt=TASK_01_PROMPT,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore more chains\n",
    "\n",
    "**➡️ Your task:** Firm up your knowledge about the two chains used in this notebook [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/llm_chain) and [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/popular/chat_vector_db).\n",

    "We recommend the **Sequential chain** and **Self-critique chain with constitutional AI**.\n",
    "How can you extend your conversational knowledge worker which is currently based on the `ConversationalRetrievalChain`?\n",
    "Summarise your idea either using pseudo code or actual code if you've time!\n",

    "\n",
    "In this session, we have built a knowledge worker use-case for accessing your complex information using Generative AI.\n",
    "This concept can be extended into a fully-fledged tool that can unlock the value of your data for customers or internal use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Going further..\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop has introduced all the LangChain knowledge required to create a knowledge worker.\n",
    "The next steps for moving this project from development to production are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decoupling LangChain from Gradio\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary to run LangChain within a GradI/O app.\n",
    "Decoupling LangChain into a separate API has several benefits:\n",
    "1. We can deploy scalable servers / Docker containers\n",
    "2. Simplified code - a frontend-backend loose coupling can lead to simpler code, which is ease to update and maintain.\n",
    "3. If a more professional user interface is needed, such as a native React app.\n",
    "Replacing GradI/O is a straightforward process - FastAPI can be called from javascript, etc., allowing you to move beyond Python frontend frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this separation can be found on the GitHub repository, using FastAPI to create a simple LangChain API server and Poetry to manage separate server environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deploying on Google Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have decoupled our frontend and backend code, we can deploy the project onto Google Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reference architecture diagrams mirror the flow diagrams we first introducted in the workshop introduction. Using Google Cloud, we can create production pipelines for creating / updating vector databases, and deploy a knowledge worker API (which can be connected to a web UI, Slack bot, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example architecture: Ingestion**\n",
    "![A typical ingestion chain](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/7f37d477b18ace5912d34b0574512559d7a457ed/assets/knowledge-worker-gcp-ingestion-pipeline.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating a pipeline for data ingestion, we can continue to extend the knowledge base of our knowledge worker as you produce new documents and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example architecture: Inference**\n",
    "![A typical ingestion chain](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/7f37d477b18ace5912d34b0574512559d7a457ed/assets/knowledge-worker-gcp-inference-pipeline.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating a pipeline for inference, we can leverage the power of Google Cloud to provide a highly reliable and scalable API that can power a variety of applications.\n",
    "\n",
