    "# Intro to LangChain (CoLab version)\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a Python framework for developing applications using language models. It abstracts the connection between applications and LLMs, allowing a loose coupling between code and specific providers like Google PaLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide details how to get started with LangChain, and walks-through setting up a knowledge worker. The files for this guide can be found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a knowledge worker\n",
    "Instead of training LLMs using your own data (ie. fine-tuning), it is far easier and more effective to adapt the LLM to your use-case by prompt engineering only (ie. tuning).\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom knowledge worker (an LLM app which only has access to specific knowledge, such as technical documentation), is described in two stages: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Knowledge embedding.\n",
    "2. LLM Query & Answer (with sources).\n",
    "\n",
    "![A typical ingestion chain](assets/typical-ingestion-chain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, documents (websites, Word documents, databases, Powerpoints, PDFs, etc.) are loaded and split into chunks. Fragmenting is important for three reasons -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are technical restrictions on how much data (tokens) can be fed into an LLM at once, meaning the context + system prompt + chat history + user prompt must fit within the token limit.\n",
    "2. Most LLM APIs operate on a per-token pricing model, meaning it is cost-effective to limit the size / amount of data provided to the LLM per query. \n",
    "3. Contextual information should be relevant to the user query, meaning it is optimial to provide only relevant snippets from documents, making the answer more relevant whilst saving costs as per (1) and (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, these document shards are embedded within a vector store. Embedding a document means to align it within a mutli-dimension space, which can then be searched according to user queries to find relevant documents. Document relevancy scoring can be as simple as a K-neighbours search, since embedded documents with similarity (as percieved by the LLM embedding model) will be proximate within the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A typical query chain](assets/typical-query-chain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vector store is created, a user can query the knowledge base using natural language questions. Relevant documents related to the query are found in the vector store by embedding the user query and finding local documents. These snippets of text are provided to the LLM (alongside the user query, chat history, prompt engineering, etc.) which parses the information to generate an answer.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def create_embeddings(source_dirs):\n",
    "    vector_store = load_embeddings()\n",
    "\n",
    "    for dir in source_dirs:\n",

    "\n",
    "    return vector_store\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also experiment with loading different document types - update the `load_documents` function to load `.pdf` or `.pptx` files, or write some logic to load any of these file types depending on an argument `document_type` (try using an `if-elif-else` switch to change which document loader is used) and embed multiple document types within the same vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you're looking to deploy a knowledge worker with several knowledge bases, a [Router Chain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/examples/multi_retrieval_qa_router.html), which combines several knowledge workers with discrete knowledge bases into a single chain which selects the best worker for the query.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "## What have we built?\n",
    "In this session, we have built a knowledge worker use-case for accessing your complex information using Generative AI. This concept can be extended into a fully-fledged tool that can unlock the value of your data for customers or internal use.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Going further..\n",
    "This workshop has introduced all the LangChain knowledge required to create a knowledge worker. The next steps for moving this project from development to production are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decoupling LangChain from GradI/O\n",
    "It is not necessary to run LangChain within a GradI/O app. Decoupling LangChain into a separate API has several benefits:\n",
    "1. We can deploy scalable servers / Docker containers\n",
    "2. Simplified code - a frontend-backend loose coupling can lead to simpler code, which is ease to update and maintain.\n",
    "3. If a more professional user interface is needed, such as a native React app. Replacing GradI/O is a straightforward process - FastAPI can be called from javascript, etc., allowing you to move beyond Python frontend frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this separation can be found on the GitHub repository, using FastAPI to create a simple LangChain API server and Poetry to manage separate server environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deploying on Google Cloud\n",
    "Once we have decoupled our frontend and backend code, we can deploy the project onto Google Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reference architecture diagrams mirror the flow diagrams we first introducted in the workshop introduction. Using Google Cloud, we can create production pipelines for creating / updating vector databases, and deploy a knowledge worker API (which can be connected to a web UI, Slack bot, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example architecture: Ingestion**\n",
    "![A typical ingestion chain](assets/knowledge-worker-gcp-ingestion-pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating a pipeline for data ingestion, we can continue to extend the knowledge base of our knowledge worker as you produce new documents and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example architecture: Inference**\n",
    "![A typical ingestion chain](assets/knowledge-worker-gcp-inference-pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating a pipeline for inference, we can leverage the power of Google Cloud to provide a highly reliable and scalable API that can power a variety of applications."
