    "# Intro to LangChain (CoLab version)\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a Python framework for developing applications using language models. It abstracts the connection between applications and LLMs, allowing a loose coupling between code and specific providers like GoogleLLM, Anthropic, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide details how to get started with LangChain, and walks-through setting up a Q&A over Documentation example. The files for this guide can be found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a knowledge worker\n",
    "Instead of training LLMs using your own data (ie. fine-tuning), it is far easier and more effective to adapt the LLM to your use-case by prompt engineering only (ie. tuning).\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom knowledge worker (an LLM app which only has access to specific knowledge, such as technical documentation), is described in two stages: 1. knowledge embedding and 2. LLM Q&A.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A typical ingestion chain](assets/typical-ingestion-chain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, documents (website pages, Word documents, databases, Powerpoints, etc.) are loaded and split into chunks. Fragmenting is important for three reasons - first, there are technical restrictions on how much data (tokens) can be fed into an LLM at once, meaning all context + prompt engineering + chat history + new query must fit within the token limit (e.g.: ~4096 tokens for GoogleLLM). Second, even if it was possible to provide entire documents as context for a query, most LLM APIs operate on a per-token pricing model, meaning it is cost-effective to limit the size / amount of data provided to the LLM per query. Third, contextually information should be relevant to the user query, meaning it is optimial to provide only relevant snippets from documents, making the answer more relevant whilst saving costs as per (1) and (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, these document shards are embedded within a vector store. Embedding a document means to align it within a mutli-dimension space, which can then be searched according to user queries to find relevant documents. Document relevancy scoring can be as simple as a K-neighbours search, since embedded documents with similarity (as percieved by the LLM embedding model) will be proximate within the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A typical query chain](assets/typical-query-chain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vector store is created, a user can query the knowledge base using natural language questions. Relevant documents related to the query are found in the vector store by embedding the user query and finding local documents. These snippets of text are provided to the LLM (alongside the user query, chat history, prompt engineering, etc.) which parses the information to generate an answer.\n",
