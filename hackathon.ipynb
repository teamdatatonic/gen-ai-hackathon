        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook walks you through the challenge of implementing a **Knowledge Worker** for your organisation using **Generative AI**!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why a knowledge worker?** Decentralized data across internal and external databases results in time wasted as workforce tries to find required information and transform into insights. A knowledge worker can consolidate this information, then answer queries in natural language providing summarisation and sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "➡️ **Your task:** Implement a knowledge worker to enable users in your company to perform Q&A, in natural language, upon a knowledge base.\n",
        "In this way, you'll centralise company data for easy access in a user-friendly manner, boosting productivity.\n",
        "As such, you'll create a knowledge worker fine-tuned to your data domain.\n",
        "This app will only have access to specific knowledge such as public data about your company available on your company's website and unstructured documents (websites, PDF, Word, text ...).\n",
        "\n",
        "While solving the tasks as instructed in this notebook, you'll familiarise yourself with common concepts and tools for Generative AI including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Open-Source tool LangChain\n",
        "- Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
        "- Text Embeddings and Vector Databases\n",
        "- Prompts and Prompt Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, this notebook details how to get started with LangChain, and walks through setting up a knowledge worker on Google Cloud and Vertex AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementing a knowledge worker\n",
        "\n",
        "When creating a knowledge worker, you recall Large Language Models (LLMs) can be tuned for a variety of tasks such as text summarisation, answering questions, and generating new content (and many more!).\n",
        "When it comes to tuning approaches, you'll have the choice between:\n",
        "\n",
        "**A) Zero-shot learning:** Use LLMs directly without providing additional data or fine-tuning the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**B) Few-shot learning:** Provide a select number of input examples when using LLM to improve the quality of outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**C) Model Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune certain (or additional) layers in the LLM by training the model on provided training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of training LLMs using your own data (ie. fine-tuning), it is far easier and more effective to adapt the LLM to your use-case by prompt engineering only (ie. tuning).\n",
        "Thus, methods A) and B) are more applicable for creating your first knowledge worker.\n",
        "\n",
        "A knowledge worker can be approached in two stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Embedding knowledge from diverse sources.\n",
        "2. Querying a LLM which is aware of your relevant knowledge to answer questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "![A typical ingestion chain](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/7f37d477b18ace5912d34b0574512559d7a457ed/assets/typical-ingestion-chain.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "First, documents (websites, Word documents, databases, Powerpoints, PDFs, etc.) are loaded and split into chunks. Fragmenting is important for three reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. There are technical restrictions on how much data (tokens) can be fed into an LLM at once, meaning the context + system prompt + chat history + user prompt must fit within the token limit.\n",
        "2. Most LLM APIs operate on a per-token pricing model, meaning it is cost-effective to limit the size / amount of data provided to the LLM per query.\n",
        "3. Contextual information should be relevant to the user query, meaning it is optimal to provide only relevant snippets from documents, making the answer more relevant whilst saving costs as per (1) and (2).\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, these document shards are embedded within a vector store. Embedding a document means to align it within a mutli-dimension space, which can then be searched according to user queries to find relevant documents. Document relevancy scoring can be as simple as a K-neighbours search, since embedded documents with similarity (as percieved by the LLM embedding model) will be proximate within the search space.\n",
        "\n",
        "![A typical query chain](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/7f37d477b18ace5912d34b0574512559d7a457ed/assets/typical-query-chain.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the vector store is created, a user can query the knowledge base using natural language questions. Relevant documents related to the query are found in the vector store by embedding the user query and finding local documents. These snippets of text are provided to the LLM (alongside the user query, chat history, prompt engineering, etc.) which parses the information to generate an answer.\n",

        "We will be using the `DirectoryLoader` and `UnstructuredHTMLLoader` in order to load a pre-compiled archive of your website. This method is similar to the [`RecursiveUrlLoader`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/integrations/recursive_url_loader). This document loader searches for subpages of a website and loads each pages content as a document. Additionally, if we only wanted to download a list of URLs without searching for subpages, we could use a [`UnstructuredURLLoader`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/integrations/url).\n",

        "It is used widely throughout LangChain, including in other chains and agents.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "It first combines the chat history (either explicitly passed in or retrieved from the provided memory) and the question into a standalone question, then looks up relevant documents from the retriever, and finally passes those documents and the question to a question answering chain to return a response.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. We can deploy scalable servers / Docker containers\n",
        "2. Simplified code - a frontend-backend loose coupling can lead to simpler code, which is ease to update and maintain.\n",
        "3. If a more professional user interface is needed, such as a native React app.\n",
