Embedding knowledge from diverse sources.\n","    * Load our dataset.\n","    * Shard our documents (e.g.: by paragraph, per 1000 tokens, etc.)\n","    * Embed the documents in Vertex AI Search or a vector store.\n","2. Querying a LLM which is aware of your relevant knowledge to answer questions.\n","    * Locating relevant documents from Vertex AI Search or a vector store.\n","    * Asking the LLM our query, providing relevant knowledge as context to generate an answer.\n","\n","![Q&A Chain Flow](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/bca8120f1408be1895309517a7a4d693035b940b/assets/qa_flow.jpeg?raw=true)\n","First, documents (websites, Word documents, databases, Powerpoints, PDFs, etc.) are loaded and split into chunks. Fragmenting is important for three reasons:\n","\n","1. There are technical restrictions on how much data (tokens) can be fed into an LLM at once, meaning the context + system prompt + chat history + user prompt must fit within the token limit.\n","2. Most LLM APIs operate on a per-token pricing model, meaning it is cost-effective to limit the size / amount of data provided to the LLM per query.\n","3. Contextual information should be relevant to the user query, meaning it is optimal to provide only relevant snippets from documents, making the answer more relevant whilst saving costs as per (1) and (2).\n","\n","Next, these document shards are embedded within a vector store. Embedding a document means to align it within a multi-dimension space, which can then be searched according to user queries to find relevant documents. Document relevancy scoring can be as simple as a K-neighbours search, since embedded documents with similarity (as percieved by the LLM embedding model) will be proximate within the search space.\n","\n","![A typical ingestion chain](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/7f37d477b18ace5912d34b0574512559d7a457ed/assets/typical-ingestion-chain.png?raw=true)\n","\n","Once the vector store is created, a user can query the knowledge base using natural language questions. Relevant documents related to the query are found in the vector store by embedding the user query and finding local documents. These snippets of text are provided to the LLM (alongside the user query, chat history, prompt engineering, etc.) which parses the information to generate an answer.\n","\n","![A typical query chain](https://github.com/teamdatatonic/gen-ai-hackathon/blob/7f37d477b18ace5912d34b0574512559d7a457ed/assets/typical-query-chain.png?raw=true)\n","\n","## Running this workshop\n","* Execute each code snippet sequentially. This lab is designed so certain steps (like defining functions or importing modules) are performed once, so each new code cell builds upon previous cells.\n","* If the notebook crashes or you want to restart the notebook later, make sure you execute all cells prior to where you left off.\n","* Executing cells out of order can lead to errors, so your first step when debugging should be to ensure all previous code cells have been run.\n","* This workshop can be completed independently, but Datatonic workshop leaders are available to discuss tasks, debug issues, or have a chat about generative AI!\n","\n","## Prerequisites\n","### Install Python dependencies\n","We've developed a python module specifically for this workshop.
