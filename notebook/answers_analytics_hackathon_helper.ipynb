    "The objective of the hackathon is to show how to use Generative AI to query BigQuery tables and extract useful insights from it. This is done by leveraging the following technologies:\n",
    "- PaLM: this is the Large Language Model (LLM) that generates the SQL code required to extract the data, as well as the text generated to provide an answer to the human\n",
    "- LangChain: this is an open-source package that allows you to easily use LLMs. LangChain introduces to concept of chains and agents. Chains are an abstraction of LLMs that already uses pre-built prompts for given tasks. For example, in this notebook you will use the `SQLDatabaseSequentialChain` (more detail on this later), which essentially orchestrates a combintation of prompts and LLM calls in sequence until the correct answer is extracted.\n",
    "- Gradio: this is friendly low-level UI tool, that allows users to create UIs and chatbots to interact with LLMs\n",
    "\n",

However, often this data is not accessible to everybody, as it requires an understanding of writing SQL code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that while data might be available, most users will not be able to access it, or will depends on skilled engineers to write the queries to gain access to data. Having an Analytics Assistant removes this bottleneck and accelerates the \"time to insight\" metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in many cases the answer to a query is not enough to provide the required insight, and multiple back-and-forth questions & answers are needed. An Analytics Assistant enables you to properly \"chat\" with your data, ask follow-up questions, and even do tasks like write emails summarising the findings. Essentially, it allows users to not just generate SQL but go beyond that and generate insights that come out of the SQL answer."

LangChain offers abstractions to multiple LLMs, both open-source and proprietary. For this notebook we will use the `VertexAI` LLM. This offers you to choose any LLM which is part of the Vertex Model Garden derived from PalM. This can be any of:\n",

    "## Task 3: Create SQL Agent with ToolKit\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a more capable LLM and Gradio interface implemented, can we make it better?\n",
    "\n",
    "One alternative to chains are agents. Whereas chains have a very well defined workflow with clear steps to follow and a start and end, LLM agents are given more freedom to try different actions and go back to the starting point and try again different methods. This is done by using the `REACT` framework and providing LLMs with toolkits. What does this mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's looka at toolkits. A toolkit is, as the word implies, an external capability that you provide to the LLM. A potential toolkit might be the Google Search API. If the LLM agent is given this toolkit, the LLM could access the Google Search API to search for information in Google. Another toolkit is the SQL toolkit (used here) which gives it acces to a SQL database. Other common toolkits are the python REPL (that allows the LLM to execute python code) or a calculator, to do mathematical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's understand the `REACT` framework. This essentially is a way that defines how an LLM agent should \"think\". While an LLM agent is given access to a tool and given the freedom to use it, the `REACT` framework (which is essentially just a prompt) tells the model what steps it should follow to know if it should use one tool or another, or just return an answer. This works by ensuring the LLM always follows the same four steps until it reaches a final answer:\n",
    "[use example from docs here] \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see here, this means LLM agents are more powerful than chains, as they can do more actions the more tools you give it, but at the same time can be harder to control. Whether you use a chain or an agent is a trade-off that depends on each use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to create a SQL agent."
