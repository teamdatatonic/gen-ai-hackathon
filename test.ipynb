    "Note: This is seperate from the Google PaLM integration. Google has chosen to offer an enterprise version of PaLM through GCP, and this supports the models made available through there. \n",

    "\n",
    "Pre-GA products and features may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA products and features may not be compatible with other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). Further, by using PaLM API on Vertex AI, you agree to the Generative AI Preview [terms and conditions](https://cloud.google.com/trustedtester/aitos) (Preview Terms).\n",
